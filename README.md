# Whiskey-Production-using-a-Batch-Distillation-Column
Malt whiskey production is essentially a double batch distillation process using pure malt, water, and yeast as the raw materials. Henry II of England first witnessed whiskey as being produced from cereals and called it the ‘water of life’.
The separation process known as distillation is a method for separating the various components of a liquid solution, which depends upon the distribution of these components between a vapor phase and a liquid phase.
It is desired to produce fine whiskey by batch distillation. Hence, a simple batch, or differential, distillation column is used, where a liquid mixture of water and ethanol is first charged to a heated kettle, boiled slowly, and the vapors are withdrawn as rapidly as they form to a condenser, where the condensed vapor (distillate), which is fine whiskey in this case, is collected. The first portion of vapor condensed will be richest in the more volatile
   
component A (ethanol), and as vaporization proceeds, the vaporized product becomes leaner in A.
Originally, a charge of L1 moles of components A (ethanol) and B (water) with a composition of x1 mole fraction of A is placed in the still. At a given time, there are L2 moles of liquid left in the still with composition x2 and the composition of the vapor leaving in equilibrium is y. A differential amount dL is vaporized.

A material balance on A can be made, where the original amount (L1) equals to the amount left in the liquid (L2) plus the amount of vapor (dL).
x . L = (x - dx) . (L - dL) + y . dL
